# Seif Platformer (Prototype)

A small 2D platformer built with **p5.js**, my first prototype exploring player physics, collisions, and level design logic.

🧩 **Current state:** early raw build — single level, working collisions, and basic trap mechanics.  
🎯 **Goal:** refactor into modular files and improve level design for smoother playability.

## 🎮 What it does
- Tile-based level rendered from array map  
- Player movement with gravity and velocity  
- Basic collision detection and death/reset logic  
- Lives counter and win condition

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** JavaScript (p5.js library)
- **Tools:** VSCode, GitHub Pages
- **Assets:** Custom tiles and sprites

## 🚧 Roadmap
- [ ] Refactor into modular components (player.js, physics.js, camera.js)
- [ ] Add checkpoints and death animations
- [ ] Add menu UI (start / pause / restart)
- [ ] Improve camera system
- [ ] Deploy updated version on GitHub Pages
